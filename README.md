BCG Introduction to Strategy Consulting Job Simulation on Forage - March 2024
Learned how to think creatively by challenging the assumptions that guide today’s thinking.
Used effective brainstorm strategies to generate ideas to help a fictional luxury clothing company increase sales revenue.

What I achieved 
I recently participated in one of BCG's job simulations on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to get an initial understanding of the work of a consultant at BCG.
I learned how to think creatively by challenging the assumptions that guide today’s thinking. I then used effective brainstorm strategies to generate ideas to help a fictional luxury clothing company increase sales revenue.
Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy thinking strategically and working with clients to come up with effective growth strategies. I'm excited to apply these skills on a consulting team at a company like BCG.
